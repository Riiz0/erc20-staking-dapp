ERC20 Staking Dapp
This is a simple decentralized application (dapp) for staking ERC20 tokens. Users can stake their tokens to earn rewards, and they can unstake their tokens at any time.

Requirements
To run this dapp, you will need the following:

Node.js
MetaMask
Hardhat
Installation
To install the dapp, clone this repository and run the following command:

npm install


This will install all of the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

To start the dapp, run the following command:

npx hardhat node

This will start a Hardhat development node.

To stake tokens, open MetaMask and connect to the Hardhat development node. Then, call the stake() function in the staking contract.

To unstake tokens, call the unstake() function in the staking contract.

Rewards
Rewards are distributed to stakers based on the amount of tokens they have staked and the staking reward rate. The staking reward rate is set by the contract owner.

Deployment
To deploy the dapp to a production network, you will need to compile and deploy the staking contract. You can do this using the Hardhat deploy task.

Once the contract is deployed, you will need to update the stakingContractAddress variable in the dapp's frontend code.
